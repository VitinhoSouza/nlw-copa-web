## Techs:
The application was built with **Next.js**, so the concept of Static Site Generation with revalidate can be applied. Also used:
- **Taliwindcss** for styling;
- **Axios** to consume a backend route;
- **TypeScript** in data typing.

## Get started:
- With Git installed, in your terminal run the following command: *git clone https://github.com/VitinhoSouza/nlw-copa-web.git*;
- Enter the project folder and do: *npm install*. When all packages are installed, do *npm run dev* to start in development mode.
